### About

Little about me, I grew up in Waldwick, NJ and
graduated in 2019 from Northwestern University
with a degree in chemical engineering. Currently working
at Superpedestrian based in Boston, MA.

Still thinking about what I want to use this site for...
maybe reflections and journaling.

But right now, I have been obsessed with Apex Legends.
