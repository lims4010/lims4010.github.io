I am Korean American, with my parents having immigrated to the States and soon after my grandparents to watch the kids. There hasn't been a movie (or one that I have watched) that I have personally identified with. A movie that resonates with my upbringing of living in America, with Korean parents working to make ends meet and learning to adapt, with Korean grandparents that spoke only Korean and brought with them a culture new to me than what I was used to at school. So, I made it a goal to eventually watch this...specifically on the big screens.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I was able to catch a viewing of Minari at a small theater in Closter, NJ with a few of my family members. A theater small enough such that outside of our group, there wound up being only three others present at the viewing.

I bought her a ticket and there we were, three generations of my family watching Minari together in theaters with two tubs of popcorn shared between us. This was a cool, memorable experience and the first time I have ever watched a movie in theaters with my grandma. She also mentioned that it had been a decade or so since her last time in a theater.

The arguments the parents had over dissenting thoughts on the farm and priorities, the growing affection between the rebellious grandson and forgiving grandmother, and the overall conversations between the family felt real.

I really appreciate the director, Lee Isaac Chung, for taking on this project and working to tell a story of life from a Korean American perspective. A story that does not seek to cheaply attract attention through shock on the racial implications of an asian family moving to the southern U.S. But instead, one that interprets the meaning of family.
